# Ekko Proxy WireMock Editor 1.6
The Ekko Proxy WireMock Editor lets you manage wiremocks for Ekko Proxy instances. The wiremock configuration files created by the editor are not just available to the proxy instances but can also be used in WireMock based unit tests.

The Mock Editor is accessed from the navigation pane and lists any virtual mocks that are available to the proxy instances:

Available WireMocks will appear in the table as shown above and are stored in a mocks folder (relative to the application).

Please see [Ekko Proxy GitHub](https://github.com/lcasoft/ekkoproxy) or [Ekko Proxy Home Page](https://www.ekkoproxy.com) for further details on how to install and use.
